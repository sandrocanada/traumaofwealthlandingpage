    <h2>Why <span class="highlight">The Trauma of Wealth</span>?</h2>
    <p>In many minority communities, the relationship with wealth is complex. Societal, familial, and cultural experiences often frame wealth as something to be feared or avoided. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
    <p>Through personal experience and deep research, Sandro Augusto Ferreira has crafted a course that addresses the <strong>emotional trauma surrounding money</strong>. This is not just about learning how to budget or invest—it's about transforming how you <em>think</em> about wealth and what you <em>believe</em> is possible for your financial future.</p>

    <h2>What You’ll Learn:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding the Trauma:</strong> Dive deep into the history and psychology behind financial limitations, especially in BIPOC communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Mindset Shifts:</strong> Learn how to change limiting beliefs around money, wealth, and success.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Tools:</strong> Gain strategies to develop healthy financial habits that lead to wealth creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy Building:</strong> Envision a future where your wealth empowers not just you, but your family and community for generations.</li>
    </ul>
